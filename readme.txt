applications quickly. With few configurations and plugin files
in text format, it is possible to create a desktop application.

menubar and/or commandbar with a working space below. Typical
user input components like string/numeric input , boolean, radio,
dropbox, file choosing etc. are required.

customizable toolframe using plugins which are totally human
friendly. It also supports typical user interface creation using
various parameters to control them. Following philosophy used 
by glade, it is possible to create automated UI creation. But 
configuration files generated by glade for UI creation are xml
files. This becomes cumbersome to manage by humans. quickdesktop
consists of quickui component which makes the above mentioned 
process through human readable file format.
